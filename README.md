# Challenges
##  A minecraft challenge plugin

### Challenges
This plugin contains the following challenges:
- Facing
- ForceBiome
- ForceEffect
- ForceGleichungen
- Math
- NoInv
- NoRemove
- OneLook

### Refactoring
Cause the plugin code is mostly unorganized and hard to understand, I'm currently refactoring the challenge system.
The old challenges are still available using the `/oldevents` command. Here is the current status of the process:
- [X] Facing
- [ ] ForceBiome
- [X] ForceEffect
- [ ] ForceGleichungen
- [ ] Math
- [ ] NoInv
- [ ] NoRemove
- [ ] OneLook
